### TaxiQL Query Explanation

This **TaxiQL query** retrieves information about a film with a specific `FilmId` (in this case, `5`). The query is designed to fetch details about the film, along with additional data obtained by making separate REST API calls to endpoints defined in the `.taxi` files. These endpoints are hosted by **Nebula**, which provides the test ecosystem.

#### Query Breakdown

1. **Input (`given`)**:  
   The query specifies a condition using the `given` clause:
   ```taxi
   given {
     films.FilmId = 5
   }
   ```
   - `films.FilmId` is the identifier for the film.
   - The query searches for details about the film with `FilmId = 5`.

2. **Data Retrieval (`find`)**:  
   The query uses the `find` clause to locate matching entities:
   ```taxi
   find { film.Film[] }
   ```
   - This retrieves all film-related data from the `film.Film` entity in the Taxi workspace.

3. **Additional Data (`as`)**:  
   The `as` clause specifies how to *project* the returned data with additional properties:
   ```taxi
   as {
     reviewScore : films.reviews.FilmReviewScore
     streamingProvider : io.vyne.films.providers.StreamingProviderName
   }
   ```
   - **`reviewScore`**:
      - Value of `films.reviews.FilmReviewScore` is obtained by making a REST API call to an endpoint specified in the `.taxi` files.
      - The endpoint fetches the review score for the film.
   - **`streamingProvider`**:
      - Value of `io.vyne.films.providers.StreamingProviderName` is similarly fetched via another REST API call.
      - This endpoint provides the name of the streaming provider offering the film.

#### Nebula's Role

- **REST API Hosting**:  
  Nebula serves the endpoints specified in the `.taxi` files. These APIs simulate external services that provide:
   - Film review scores (`films.reviews.FilmReviewScore`).
   - Streaming provider names (`io.vyne.films.providers.StreamingProviderName`).

- **Data Correlation**:  
  TaxiQL seamlessly integrates the API responses with the main query results, correlating the fetched data using the `FilmId`.


This demonstrates how TaxiQL combines data from both the Taxi workspace and external APIs to create a unified, enriched dataset.
